# Instrument Subsystem

The instrument subsystem includes all instruments both custom made and purchased for remote sensing of ice sheets and glaicers that we integrate into the UWrover.

## Ground penetrating radar
The rover tows a minituraized high frequency radar transmitter and reciever in parallel and uses precise gelocation information to determine the two way travel time of englacial layering and bed reflectivity along preloaded waypoints.

## Global positioning system
Positioning for navigation and englacial refleciton calculations are derived from two linked kinematic septentrio GNSS. Positioning information is transfered and logged in NEMA string fromat making it possible to substitute GNSS devices.

## SLR cameras
We use SLR cameras to determine surface snow grain properties and infer the density.
